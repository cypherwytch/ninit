# ninit

A non-interactive utility to initialize a `nimble` package. Provides the same functionality as `nimble init`, but is fully non-interactive and can be used in automation tasks. The generated packages should be (near-)identical to those generated by `nimble` itself.

The tool does not have a runtime dependency on `nimble`, so it can initialize packages without `nimble` being available. However, because it generates `nimble` packages, the generated packages themselves *do* require `nimble` in order to be built or tested.

### Known issues

Does not currently support initializing an `hg` repository the way `nimble` does.
